    Definition of the firealarm API between a fire alarm system and Magazino Fleet Manager.

    The fire alarm system connects to the MQTT broker and sets its last will to the state "offline" on the state topic.
    Afterwards, depending on the state of the fire alarm system, either the state "ok" or "alarm" (in case of an alarm) is published.

    The keep-alive of 60 seconds ensures that the Magazino Fleet Manager can treat the absense of the fire alarm system like the alarm state and start the respective procedures.
