    Definition of the firealarm API between a fire alarm system and Magazino
    Fleet Manager.

    The fire alarm system connects to the MQTT broker and publishes periodically
    on the state topic.  Depending on the state of the fire alarm system, either
    the state `false` (no alarm) or `true` (in case of an alarm) is published.

    The fire alarm system must publish periodically at least every 30 seconds.
    The absence of a message (=timeout) is treated by the Magazino Fleet Manager
    like the alarm state and starts the respective procedures.

    The message should be published retained, so that the master controller
    knows the last state of the fire alarm system after restart.
